          <p class="about-text">
            <span>The N95 mask</span> is a form of respiratory protective wear
            worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling
            airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable
            mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly
            specialised process called melt blowing. During this process, the
            inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms the filtration
            layer capable of filtering out at <span>least 95%</span> of airborne
            particles when worn correctly.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
            intense air pollution, wearing <span>N95 masks</span> has been shown
            to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out
            nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate
            existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered
            respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and
            people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can
            particularly benefit from wearing face masks while they are out in
            public and unable to control the breathing environments that they
            find themselves in.

            N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
          </h3>
          <p class="about-text">
            Most <span>N95 respirators</span> are manufactured for use in
            construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to
            dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National
            Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National
            Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part
            of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care
            setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective
            devices used and worn by health care personnel during procedures to
            protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer
            of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These
            surgical N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA,
            under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
